# Minimal Example: NuSEDS Fraser-area Coho Sample

This is a minimal example of a Salmon Data Package (SDP) demonstrating the structure and metadata required for a valid SDP package.

## Package Contents

- `dataset.csv` - Dataset-level metadata
- `tables.csv` - Table metadata
- `column_dictionary.csv` - Column definitions with ontology links
- `codes.csv` - Controlled vocabulary codes
- `data/` - (Data files would go here; this example uses metadata only)

## Dataset Description

This example package contains metadata for a sample of coho escapement records from PFMA 29 (Fraser River watershed) exported from NuSEDS (New Salmon Escapement Database System).

## Usage

This example can be used to:
- Understand the SDP structure
- Test SDP validation tools
- Serve as a template for creating new SDP packages

See the [main specification](../../SPECIFICATION.md) for details on each metadata file.
